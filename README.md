- **Three Modes**:
  - **Chat**: General conversation with AI assistant
  - **Memory Lane**: Guided conversations about memories and experiences

- **AI-Powered**: Uses Gemini API for intelligent, patient responses

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- Gemini AI API for chat responses
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- Multer for file handling (voice uploads)

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Browser Speech Recognition API
- Axios for API communication
- React Icons for UI elements
- Responsive CSS with accessibility features

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser with speech recognition support

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mrunmayee17/Dementia-companion.git
   cd Dementia-companion
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for all parts:**
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the template file
   cp server/.env.template server/.env
   
   # Edit the .env file and add your API keys
   # Get Gemini API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   ```
   
   Update `server/.env` with your keys:
   ```env
   PORT=5001
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here  # Optional
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here  # Optional
   ```

4. **Start the desktop application:**
   ```bash
   ./launch-desktop.sh
   ```

   Or manually:
   ```bash
   # Start server first
   cd server && node index.js &
   
   # Then start desktop app
   cd ../client && npm run electron
   ```

   The server runs on port 5001 and the desktop app loads locally.

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If the above doesn't work, you can start each part manually:

1. **Start the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the frontend (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
